"""A WebTransport session object, over Weft's ASGI extension.

ASGI has no WebTransport specification, so Weft defines one. It is a
message protocol, in the same shape as ASGI's HTTP and WebSocket ones, and
writing against it directly is perfectly possible:

    async def app(scope, receive, send):
        assert (await receive())["type"] == "webtransport.connect"
        await send({"type": "webtransport.accept"})
        ...

What this module adds is the part every application would otherwise write for
itself: one `receive()` channel has to be demultiplexed into several streams, a
datagram queue, and the answers to stream-open requests, and doing that by hand
in every endpoint is both tedious and easy to get wrong.

    async def endpoint(session):
        await session.accept()
        async for stream in session.incoming_streams():
            data = await stream.read()
            await stream.send(b"echo:" + data, end=True)

Backpressure is per stream, not per session. A full stream queue sends
`webtransport.stream.pause`, which leaves that stream's bytes in the QUIC
buffer so its window does not reopen. The pump keeps reading, so every other
stream and every datagram still move. `resume` is sent when the application
drains the queue again. Datagrams are unreliable: a full datagram queue drops
the oldest, matching the server.
