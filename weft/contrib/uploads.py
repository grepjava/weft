                           on_complete=finished)

Serve `app`. It answers the upload routes itself and hands everything else to
`api` unchanged, lifespan included.

This is the IETF resumable upload protocol (draft-ietf-httpbis-resumable-
upload, interop version 9), the same one Garuda's GarudaUploads serves. An
upload to `/files` whose client speaks it -- it sends `Upload-Complete` -- is
told where the upload lives with a 104 before a byte of the body is read, and
everything that reaches the server is kept as it arrives. If the connection
drops, the client asks the upload's URL how much arrived (HEAD) and sends the
rest from there (PATCH, as `application/partial-upload`), as many times as it
takes, over any protocol and on any worker. A client that does not speak it
gets an ordinary upload. Either way `on_complete` is called once, with the
whole body on disk, and its answer is the response to the request that
finished the upload.

The routes, below wherever the application is mounted:

    POST    <path>            create, with some or all of the body
    OPTIONS <path>            the limits, as Upload-Limit
    HEAD    <uploads>/<id>    the offset, whether it is complete, the length
    GET     <uploads>/<id>    the same, and once it is complete, the answer
                              `on_complete` gave, for a client whose
                              connection died before it arrived
    PATCH   <uploads>/<id>    append at the offset the client names
    DELETE  <uploads>/<id>    cancel

What the draft leaves to the server, decided as Garuda decides it:

  * A request for an upload another request is still appending to. The older
    one is usually a connection that died without either side noticing, and
    the client has come back on a new one. When the older request is on the
    same event loop it is ended, what it received is kept, and the new request
    goes on -- a HEAD included, as the draft recommends, which is why a client
    must not ask for the offset while it is still sending. When it is on
    another worker, the new request waits a moment for it and is answered 409
    (an append) or 503 (HEAD, GET, DELETE) with Retry-After if it is still
    going: an offset still growing is one the next append would be refused
    at.
  * An `on_complete` that raises. The upload stays complete and the client is
    answered 500, as the draft's own example of a failed completion is: every
    byte arrived, so there is nothing left to resume, and HEAD says so. The
    bytes stay in the store until `max_age`, for the application to reconcile.
  * An answer that never arrived. The answer to the request that completed an
    upload is remembered as it is sent, and given again to a GET of the
    upload's URL until `max_age`. It outlives the bytes, so a handler that
    files them away and removes the upload still answers the client that lost
    its answer.
  * What the application knows about an upload. The request that creates one
    and the request that completes it are different requests, so `on_create`
    is given the creating request's scope, and the dict of strings it returns
    is kept on the upload and handed to `on_complete` as `metadata`. The
    server writes it and no client can reach it, which is what makes it the
    place for whose upload this is. Raising `Refused` from it turns the upload
    away before anything is written.
  * Progress: a 104 with the current offset every `progress_interval` bytes.
  * Expiry: uploads older than `max_age` are removed, complete or not, when
    the next one is created. `on_complete` should move a finished upload's
    bytes to where they belong.

Interim responses need a server that sends them. Under Weft that is
`http.response.informational`; under a server without it the uploads still
work, and a client cut off during the request that created an upload simply
has no URL to resume, and starts again.

Writes are ordinary blocking system calls on the event loop's thread: for a
local disk that is the same trade as serving a static file.

class ResumableUploads:
    """An ASGI application serving resumable uploads at `path`, and passing
    every other request to `app` unchanged.

    `uploads` is the path each upload's own URL is made under. Both it and
    `path` are within the application: under `--root-path /api` they are
    served at `/api/files` and `/api/uploads/<id>`, and the URLs the client
    is given say so.

    `on_complete(upload)` is called once each upload has all its bytes, with a
    `CompletedUpload`; it may be a coroutine function. What it returns is the
    response to the request that finished the upload: None (204), a status, a
    body, `(status, body)`, `(status, headers, body)`, or an ASGI response
    object such as Starlette's. It should move the bytes where they belong and
    call `upload.remove()`.

    `on_create(scope)` is called on the request that creates an upload, before
    anything is written, and returns a dict of strings to keep on it as
    `metadata`; raise `Refused` to turn it away.
