"""WebTransport and HTTP/3 for FastAPI and Starlette.

FastAPI is a Starlette application, and Starlette's router asserts that a scope
is `http`, `websocket` or `lifespan` before it looks at anything else. A
WebTransport session is none of those, so it has to be answered before the
framework sees it:

    from fastapi import FastAPI
    from weft.contrib.fastapi import WebTransportRouter

    api = FastAPI()
    app = WebTransportRouter(api)          # serve this one

    @app.route("/echo")
    async def echo(session):
        await session.accept()
        async for stream in session.incoming_streams():
            await stream.send(b"echo:" + await stream.read(), end=True)

Paths use Starlette's spelling: `{room}`, `{count:int}`, `{id:uuid}`.

Everything that is not a WebTransport session goes to `api` untouched, so the
rest of the application is unaffected -- including over HTTP/3, which needs no
integration at all because a request is the same request whatever carried it.
